		<h1> 2023 School Year Classes </h1>
		<p> This year I took 7 classes including English, APCSP, Math, Honors Chemistry, Spanish, Health Science and Modern World History. My favorite class this year was english because I enjoy reading and writing. My hardest class this year was chemistry. I enjoyed all my classes this year and I am looking forward to the classes I am taking in the future. <p>
